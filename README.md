# Flask Application for TechLabs Group Project

This Flask app was created for the group project I worked on for the TechLabs Amsterdam "Data Science with Python" course. Our team created a machine learning model to predict the price of an Airbnb rental in Amsterdam, and this repository contains the code for the front-end of the project.

[The app is hosted on Heroku here.](https://geo7-price-predict.herokuapp.com/) *Please be aware the first load may be slow as Heroku sleeps the application after 30 minutes of inactivity.*
